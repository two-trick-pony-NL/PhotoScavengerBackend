# Photoscavenger App! 
This is the FastAPI backend that supports my PhotoScavenger Apps. It can detect certain objects from pictures. This API serves my iOS/Android apps for the game here: https://photoscavenger.petervandoorn.com
API dashboard is here: https://photoscavenger.vdotvo9a4e2a6.eu-central-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/

Here is a in-game screenshot: <br>

- API  [documentation](https://photoscavenger.vdotvo9a4e2a6.eu-central-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/docs).
- App on [appstore](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/photo-scavenger/id1637234234?l=en)

# What does it do:
This backend can check images to see if a certain object is on the picture. For instance: you can check if there is a cat on a particular photo. The backend will then return a false or true for that object depending on whether it was found. It will also return a list objects it managed to find. This allows you validate in case of false negatives, to see what the model thought was on the picture. See an example below. 

# How does it work: 
you make a POST request with a image in the formdata (content type 'file'). 
For instance this image:

and it returns an image with the detected objects:

# How to run: 

Simply clone the repo and run: 
```
gh repo clone two-trick-pony-NL/ScanGameBackend && cd ScanGameBackend
```
 
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --reload
```

# V1 vs V2 
The V1 API has 18 objects to be detected and V2 can detect 80 different objects

# Getting a new assignment
Note: Corrospond the right assignment API with the correct image detector API. As the V1 version will only know the 18 classes that AI model has. Also, the integer at the end of the call is the score the player currently has. The higher the score the more difficult the object is to find. 

### V1
```
http://localhost:8000/newassignment/2000
```

### V2
```
http://localhost:8000/v2/newassignment/2000
```

response:
```
{"dog":"üêï"}
```
